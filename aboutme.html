            <p class="description">Hello! My name is Farrah, and I learning to code. 
        I am a ScriptEd student; I was initially interested in joining ScriptEd 
        because of the internship opportunity. In addition to that, I am also 
        interested in coding due to my gaming hobby. One day, I would like to program 
        a video game.</p>
